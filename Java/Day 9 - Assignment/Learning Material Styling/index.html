    <h1>Why to Learn Java Programming?</h1>
    <p title="java">
        Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer, especially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Object Oriented</dt>
        <dd>In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</dd>
        
        <dt>Platform Independent</dt>
        <dd>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform-specific machine code. Instead, Java is compiled into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.</dd>
        
        <dt>Simple</dt>
        <dd>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</dd>
        
        <dt>Secure</dt>
        <dd>With Java's secure feature, it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</dd>
        
        <dt>Architecture-neutral</dt>
        <dd>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of a Java runtime system.</dd>
        
        <dt>Portable</dt>
        <dd>Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation-dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.</dd>
        
        <dt>Robust</dt>
        <dd>Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile-time error checking and runtime checking.</dd>
